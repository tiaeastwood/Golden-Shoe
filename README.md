## About

Website redesign demo for Golden Shoe.

The frontend is a responsive design built with React, with use of Styled Components and Material UI Components.

For the product data, I created a fake API for demonstration purposes using json-server.
The API has a _/shoes_ endpoint, which can be accessed at _localhost:4000/shoes_.

I have used Axios to request the data from the API.

Items can be added to the cart and are stored using localstorage.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

2. Run the json-server fake API. In the root directory:

```
npm run server
```

3. Run the frontend app. In the root directory:

```
npm start
```
