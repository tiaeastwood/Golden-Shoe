## About

Website redesign demo for Golden Shoe.

The frontend is built with React, with use of Styled Components and Material UI Components.

For the product data, I created a fake API for demonstration purposes using json-server.
The API has a */shoes* endpoint, which can be accessed at *localhost:4000/shoes*.
I have used Axios to request the data from the API.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies

```
npm i
```
2. Run the json-server fake API. In the root directory:
```
npm run server
```
3. Run the frontend app. In the root directory:

```
npm start
```
